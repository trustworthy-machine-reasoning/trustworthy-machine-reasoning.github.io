            Recent advances in foundation models have led to remarkable progress in machine reasoning, enabling systems to solve increasingly complex tasks in mathematics, coding, science, and real-world decision making. However, despite these gains, foundation model reasoning often suffers from critical trustworthiness issues, including sensitivity to noisy inputs, hallucinated or misleading reasoning traces, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, and limited interpretability.
          </p>
          <p>
            This tutorial aims to establish a unified and systematic understanding of trustworthy machine reasoning with foundation models. Rather than treating reasoning performance, robustness, safety, and interpretability in isolation, we synthesize recent progress across prompting, test-time scaling, post-training, and agentic reasoning frameworks, highlighting how these components jointly shape trustworthy reasoning behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tutorial is organized into four main parts. First, we introduce the foundations of machine reasoning in large models, discussing its capabilities, limitations, and emerging trends. Second, we present core techniques for trustworthy reasoning in foundation models, including prompting strategies, test-time scaling methods, and post-training approaches that enhance robustness and safety. Third, we extend the discussion to foundation agents, covering tool-augmented, multi-agent, and multi-modal reasoning, along with their unique trustworthiness challenges. Finally, we examine real-world applications and open research problems, focusing on trustworthy code agents and agentic coding systems that integrate reasoning and tool use for reliable deployment. By consolidating recent advances and open challenges, this tutorial seeks to provide a foundation for future research on trustworthy machine reasoning systems.

He was a visiting student at the Stanford Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (STAIR) Lab at Stanford University, working with Prof. Sanmi Koyejo. His research focuses on trustworthy machine reasoning with foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), to solve complex problems such as mathematics and coding, as well as to accelerate scientific discovery and applications in fields such as biology, chemistry, and healthcare. He believes that reasoning is an essential pathway toward achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). Trustworthy machine reasoning encompasses key properties including reasoning capability, robustness, safety, and explainability.
